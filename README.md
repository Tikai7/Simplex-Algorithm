# Simplex-Algorithm

  This is a React Native application of the simplex algorithm.
  The simplex algorithm is designed to minimize or maximize a linear program.

# How to use it

   - Enter the number of constraints and all the variables of your linear program (in standard form).

   Result : 
      You will then get all the steps to solve the program.
